      <h1>What is neuroplasticity?</h1>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganise itself by
        forming new neural connections throughout life. This process allows
        neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease
        and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes
        in the environment. Neuroplasticity can occur at various levels, from
        changes in the strength of existing connections between neurons to the
        growth of new neurons and the formation of entirely new neural pathways.
        Neuroplasticity plays a crucial role in learning and memory, as well as
        in recovery from brain injuries such as strokes. It also underlies
        processes such as skill acquisition, adaptation to sensory inputs, and
        recovery from trauma or addiction. This dynamic ability of the brain to
        adapt and rewire itself is fundamental to its functioning and
        resilience.

      <h1>What is a growth mindset?</h1>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is a belief or attitude that individuals can develop
        and improve their abilities and intelligence through effort,
        perseverance, and learning. Coined by psychologist Carol Dweck, the
        concept contrasts with a fixed mindset, which is the belief that
        intelligence and abilities are innate traits that cannot be
        significantly changed. In a growth mindset, individuals view challenges,
        setbacks, and failures as opportunities for learning and growth rather
        than as indicators of their limitations. They embrace the idea that with
        dedication and practice, they can develop new skills, overcome
        obstacles, and achieve their goals. People with a growth mindset tend to
        be more resilient, motivated, and willing to take on new challenges.
