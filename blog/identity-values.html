      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
      <p>
        I don't ask myself the question of "Who am I?" very often as it is very
        open ended and requires a lot of introspection. I think it is something
        I don't like to think about very often because the answer usually just
        ends up being that I'm just another person in the world and there's
        nothing special about me that makes me different from anyone else. A
        basic explanation of who I am might be that I'm just a regular 25 year
        old guy from Auckland who's trying to make a big decision in his life by
        career changing.
