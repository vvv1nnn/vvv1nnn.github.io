      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

        Ethics, the moral principles that govern behaviour, serve as the compass
        guiding individuals and societies towards what is deemed right and just.
        Rooted in philosophies, cultures, and religions, ethics shape our
        decisions, interactions, and societal structures. They provide a
        framework for distinguishing between right and wrong, fair and unfair,
        moral and immoral. Ethical considerations encompass a wide array of
        topics, from individual actions to global policies, encompassing issues
        such as justice, integrity, honesty, compassion, and respect for others.
        Upholding ethical standards fosters trust, integrity, and harmony within
        communities, while ethical lapses can lead to distrust, conflict, and
        societal breakdown.
      </p>

        My personal belief in ethics and a value that I hold highly is to live
        by the rule of “in the happiness of others, lies our own”. This phrase
        was widely used by His Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj, a spiritual
        leader of BAPS which is a sect of Hinduism. It was a way of life for him
        and I try to abide by the same way of life. I can think of many
        instances where I personally have sacrificed part of my own happiness to
        make others happy, even if it was something insignificant like giving
        the last lollipop to a small child rather than keeping it for yourself
        or giving a plushy away to a baby that was crying at the arcade instead
        of keeping it. I think there is immense gratification in making others
        happy and expecting no return from it.

        I think this ties into the fact that I am an INFP on the Myers-Briggs
        Type Indicator (MBTI); this personality type has the introverted,
        intuitive, feeling and prospective personality traits.
        16personalities.com states that “INFP personalities share a sincere
        curiosity about the depths of human nature. Introspective to the core,
        they're exquisitely attuned to their own thoughts and feelings, but they
        yearn to understand the people around them as well.” INFPs tend to be
        empathetic, generous, open-minded, creative, passionate and idealistic.
        I think this will help me on my learning journey as when I'm working
        with others I'm more accepting of others ideas and see things from
        others point of view easier; I also strive to follow my conscience and
        rarely lose sight of my goals so that also helps with doing projects.
        Some weaknesses include being unrealistic, self-isolating, unfocused at
        times, emotionally vulnerable, too eager to please others and too self
        critical. I think some of these can hinder my learning process as
        sometimes I try to be too perfect; one example would be when creating
        the blog website, I tried making everything as perfect as possible and
        went through 3 iterations of designs before I chose one I actually liked
        and that ate up a lot of time that I could've spent on doing something
        else.

        When I was a project engineer in construction, I used to lead a team of
        around 10 or more people as a very young engineer. This meant most of
        the labourers wouldn't have much respect for me as I was young and they
        wouldn't listen to what I say. I had to prove myself and show that I
        knew what I was talking about for the teams I was in to respect me.
        Sometimes there was internal conflict and I had to solve it; one
        instance was when I had organised the weekly plan and structure and some
        of the team members were unhappy with the schedule. I had to compromise
        at the time and change it up to how they thought it should be as I
        wanted to keep my team happy and also take into consideration what their
        thoughts were in the plan. I think I would do the same now unless their
        inputs into the schedule were flawed and would mess things up.
