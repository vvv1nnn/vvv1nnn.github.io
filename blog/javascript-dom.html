      <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript(JS) is the language of the web; it is a scripting language
        that is commonly used to creat interactive and dynamic webpages. Rather
        than everything flat and similar to a painting, JS allows HTML and CSS
        to be updated aswell as calculate, manipulate and validate data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some basic concepts of JS can be split up into:
        <strong>arrays, objects, functions, loops and control flow.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are both data types in JS that are mutable and store
        collections of data. Since they are so similar, in what situations would
        you use either of them?
      </p>
      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Objects are ussed to represet a specfic thing in the code. It can be
        anything from a user, a car, an animal, etc. These things all have
        characteristics that can be made into properties of that certain thing.
        In JS objects, properties are called keys and they have a value assigned
        to them. For exmaple:
      </p>
    </div>
    <img src="../images/object-example.PNG" class="picture" />
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Objects can be accessed, properties added, changed, removed by dot
        notation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <img src="../images/altering-objects.PNG" class="picture" />
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        Arrays are used when there is a list of items that need to be stored
        into a single variable. They are useful when you need to create ordered
        collections which need to be accessed by indexed. They can also store
        any sort of data from strings, numbers, booleans, objects or other
        arrays.
      </p>
    </div>
    <img src="../images/array-example.PNG" class="picture" />
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <p>
        A function is code that is designed to perform tasks. It is executed
        when it is called for in the code. Functions can take parameters and use
        them within the code; they also return values back to use in the greater
        code block. Functions are pretty much like a recipe that you can use
        over and over again without rewriting the same thing every single time
        you want to make that specific thing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <img src="../images/function-example.PNG" class="picture" />
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Loops</h1>
      <p>
        In JS, loops allow a sequence of code to be repeated for a given amount
        of times. The amount of times a loop is repeated for is decided by the
        iterator within the loop which is usually denoted by the variable
        <strong>i</strong>. The iterator changes value after every time the loop
        is iterated through and when it reaches the value which it is meant to
        stop at, the loop stops. Loops are a efficent way of iterating through
        objects and arrays to change values or perform and repetitive task
        efficiently. In the example below, the loop will console log the value
        of the iterator at every iteration. At the end of the iteration, the
        iterator goes up by 1 and the max value it can have is 4.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h1>Control Flow</h1>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order in which code is executed; code will be
        executed from the top to the bottom by the computer. It is just like
        instructions you follow to make a model gundam for example, you wouldn't
        build something from the end and go to the start, you'd do it in order.
      </p>
      <h1>The DOM</h1>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model or DOM represents the whole webpage including
        the HTML, CSS and JavaScript combined into one. JavaScript can
        manipulate the DOM through the document interface to change HTML and CSS
        elements. It can be viewed through the Chrome Developer Tools,
        CTRL+SHIFT+I. The document acts as the roots of the webpage and HTML and
        CSS make up different branches of the tree.
