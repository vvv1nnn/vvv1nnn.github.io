      <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence or Emtional Quotient (EQ) is the ability to
        recognize, understand, manage, and express one's own
        emotions, as well as to perceive, interpret, and respond appropriately
        to the emotions of others. It allows individuals to navigate social
        interactions, communicate effectively, empathise with others, and manage
        interpersonal relationships.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is often defined by four attributes:
        <ol>
          <li>Self-management: The ability to manage and control one's own emotions, impulses, and reactions in various situations. This involves being able to stay calm under pressure, adapt to change, and maintain a positive outlook.</li>
          <li>Self-awareness: The ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, values, and motivations.</li>
          <li>Social Awareness: The skill of understanding and empathizing with the emotions, needs, and perspectives of others. It involves being attentive to social cues, listening actively, and showing empathy and compassion towards others.</li>
          <li>Relationship Management: The ability to establish and maintain healthy, meaningful relationships with others. This includes effective communication, conflict resolution, teamwork, and the ability to inspire and influence others positively.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        People with higher EQs are more likely to be happy and have higher chances of developing strong bonds with the people around them, whether that be friends, family or coworkers. Therefore
        emotional intelligence is very important for when you are working in a team. Having a higher EQ can mean that you can navigate difficult stituations at work in an easier way as you have
        a better understanding of your own and other peoples feelings.

        How can I train my EQ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The brain has a trait called neuroplasticity; this simply means that the structure of the brain the malleable; we can train and change our brain the same way we can train muscles and the gym. 
        Most of the soft skills that make up emotional intellegence are skills that people are not born with, they can be learnt. There are 3 practices you can implement to train your EQ:
        <ol>
          <li>Mindfulness Practice: This is another way of saying meditation, which can be found in many different cultures and religions all around the world, notably Hinduism and Buddhism.
            It can help cultivate focus and attention, aswell as calming an individual down, giving them a calm, clear and alert mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Concious listening: Listening to someone else talk, it can be about anything really, all you have to do is focus on their subject and just listen. 
          </li>
          <li>Journaling: This can be a way to brain dump your feelings about anything. It is a private way to express yourself and look back at it whenever you want to. </li>
