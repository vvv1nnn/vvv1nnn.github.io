      <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
      <p>Three things I learnt about myself and my ego during core learning:
      <ul>
        <li>I am relatively humble most of the time</li>
        <li>
          I still need to learn how to apply all of these core skills into my
          day to day life
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't think I am that egotistical from what I have seen so far
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Self-awareness plays a big role in learning and coding as it lets you
        know what your limitations are. If you have no self-awareness, it might
        mean you can be over estimating yourself; you could start struggling
        with problems that you thought were easy but you don't actually know how
        to properly solve them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most surprising thing about core learning is that a lot of it is
        stuff that I have learnt previously in other areas of study or even just
        by myself on the internet. It is stuff that you come across every day
        but you never really think about. The most challenging aspects of core
        learning was writing the blogs since its been a long time since I've
        properly written essay style blogs, it has mostly just been reports of
        data anaylsis in the past few years. It was a good experience relearning
        how to write in a blog and essay style again.

        I think Devacademy focuses on core learning a lot since it helps people
        learn every day skills that are very useful at work or even at home.
        Solidifying these skills means that you can be a better programmer at
        work and work with others in teams in a more efficient way. I don't
        think it is a waste of time to learn these core skills; practising
        programming can obviously make you a better programmer but learning core
        skills can make you a better person.
