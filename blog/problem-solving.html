      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <p>
        One easy problem I got stuck on was when I was working with my
        engineering thesis with AI and machine learning. I had very minimal
        experience with python and data analysis at that time so I was really
        struggling with some of the ways we were using to iterate through the
        data and turn it into charts. I overcame this problem by watching lots
        of YouTube videos of methods similar to the ones that my group was using
        and to write similar code. It was very frustrating at first but the more
        time I put it into it and the more I researched, the easier it got.

        I think pseudocode is a technique I use a lot while coding, I normally
        write the pseudocode down on paper first as it is easier for me to
        visualise that way and I am used to writing code on paper from
        university(pretty archaic). I also tend to console.log() my code a lot
        to check the outputs of functions and even within functions to see
        what's happening. It is similar to using print on pythong so I am used
        to that and it usually tends to be a very effective way for me to code.
        I also end up googling a lot of problems but I don't like reading code
        from websites such as stack overflow as I usually get distracted, I
        rather prefer searching up methods on youtube and integrating those
        methods into my code.
