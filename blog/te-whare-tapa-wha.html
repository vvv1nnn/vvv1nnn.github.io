      <h1>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h1>
      <p>
        My way of keeping my physical well being in good shape is by going to
        the gym 2-3 times a week and going bouldering 2 times a week. It keeps
        me in good shape and healthy and in a good mindset to tackle anything
        thrown at me.

      <h1>Taha WhƒÅnau (Family Wellbeing)</h1>
      <p>
        I usually have dinner with my family every evening and I also try to
        talk to my parents about how my day went and what I did. It is the
        simplest way to keep my family well being on top and keeping my
        connections with my parents.

      <h1>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h1>
      <p>
        For mental health, I usually like to just sit down on a park bench and
        just enjoy nature or go do some hobbies I enjoy such as photography.

      <h1>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h1>
      <p>
        My spiritual wellbeing is stregthened by going to the temple every
        weekend and joining in the activities at the temple.

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h1>
      <p>
        My connection to the land and environment usually comes by going for
        walks or hikes, its not barefoot but I think being in nature itself has
        a similar effect. I'm not a very avid swimmer so I don't do that very
        often.
