      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>
        One longterm goal for me is to get a stable job in the tech industry
        after I finish this bootcamp. I would like to work as a junior developer
        or get into software consulting with salesforce and more of the data
        analytic side of coding. I have done research into these roles and I
        have seen that they can lead into roles such as product owner or product
        manager in the future with 3-5 years of experience in consulting and
        project management. I have plenty of project management experience
        through my previous job as a project engineer at a construction company
        and now I need to get experience with the tech side of things.

        I think the best way I learn is from visual methods; I usually find that
        visual ways of learning suits me best and I can pick up things very
        easily if I'm watching a video or looking at charts, pictures and maps.
        Learning through audio would be second as I like listening to things and
        I find I can remember things quite quickly when I've heard them a few
        times; I tend to listen to audio books or podcasts about topics I like
        and can remember and recall things from them quite regularly. I think my
        weakest way of learning things would be through reading but that's
        mostly because I'm not reading and then rewriting the things I've read
        which is the main part of learning through reading. I also like learning
        by teaching others as it helps me solidify content that I've learnt.

        I think a skill I'd like to improve upon while at Devacademy is working
        in a team more efficiently and working with people that are from
        different walks of life than me.

        I tend to manage workload quite well after working in construction for 3
        years. All my experience so far has taught to me to start on assignments
        and projects early and research everything I need to complete the
        project at the start so I don't fumble around too much in the middle of
        it. So far I have been just breezing through the content of the sprints
        easily since there isn't too much but when it ramps up, I'll be
        reviewing the time it takes to finish the sprint on Sunday/Monday and
        then splitting up all the sections throughout the days of the week. If I
        start struggling with the workload I will ask for help from the
        facilitators on discord and ask for an extension if need be. I can also
        ask from help from the facilitators and other students on discord if I
        get stuck and don't understand parts of the content. What I expect from
        the facilitation team is to answer questions on the discord quickly,
        which has been done so far and its fantastatic. I also think they
        provide really good insight and advice on things we share on the
        discord.

        I don't have any set times where I'm commited to other things right now.
        For work I'm usually doing photoshoots and those times vary and are
        usually just on friday nights and on weekends. I also go climbing often
        but that is also usually on the weekend or at night so it doesn't affect
        my studying during the day.
